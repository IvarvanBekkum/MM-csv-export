# MM-csv-export
This little piece of code is to create output from myTracks to be used in the MilkMachine-plugin in QGis (dev 2016).

This repository is related to MilkMachine - https://github.com/IvarvanBekkum/MilkMachine - and myTracks.
We, PolakVanBekkum, created MilkMachine software from 2003 on for plotting, converting and editing gps-data. The latest version of MilkMachine 
software was developed by Ed Farrell and Sean MacGinnis as a plugin for QGis.

We have been using QStarz gps-loggers for a really long time now and those behaved somewhat tricky when reading from 
a Mac. We finally found myTracks to function relatively stable, but the export from myTracks to the needed format 
for our new MilkMachine plugin was not available in the right format. With this little add-on we can export csv files from
myTracks that can be used in MilkMachine.
